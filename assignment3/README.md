2. You have a workflow running on GitHub Action that has the following code;
```
jobs:
  deploy_to_production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy to production with soruce code
    steps:
      - name: Checkout GitHub Action

      - name: Login via Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: deploy to production step with soruce code
        uses: azure/spring-cloud-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
